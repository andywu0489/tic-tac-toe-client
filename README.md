Planning and Development Process

I began the planning process by creating the user stories. From the user stories I sketched out the wireframes. I then created the basic layout of the board in HTML and SCSS. Afterwards I created a game board in JS and created the game logic to determine player turns and wins/draws. Once complete I moved on to the game UI adding click handler to add x or o's to clicked spaces and adding user messages that display player turn, and when the game is over. I then worked on authorization, setting up sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, change-password and their associated success/fail messages. The game API came last, added ability to get previous game statistics, to update games, and to create games.

Unsolved Problems:
Was unable to get the invalid moves message working properly. Those sections of code are currently commented out. Hope to fix in future iterations. Also hope to add styling and to get the page to look more like my wireframes. And to make the page look better at different sizes.

User Stories:

-As a user, I want to be able to sign in so that I can have my own account.

-As a user, I want to be able to switch turns between X and O so that I can play against myself or others.

-As a user, I want there to be support to play multiple games, one at a time.

-As a user, I want be able to retrieve game statistics.

-As a user, I want the game to let me know when a side wins or show draw when no one wins.

-As a user, I want to be able to start a new game with the click of a button after a game has ended so that I don't need to refresh the page.
